# small-brainfuck
INCOMPLETE Brainfuck interpreter written in C, focused on code size  
Currently at ```233``` bytes, tho nested loops do not work!  
##
### Usage:
1. Insert your brainfuck code where ```d``` (char array) is initialized (empty double quotes near the start of line 2)
2. Compile it with gcc  
## 
Feel free to open a pull request if you have an idea on how to shrink the code (every byte counts) or if you found a bug
